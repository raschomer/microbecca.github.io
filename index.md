## Dr. Rebecca Schomer

I grew up in the Rocky Mountains outside of Albuquerque, NM, where I established a fascination with the natural world, collecting insects, cataloging rocks, anc counting birds. I entered college intent upon studying primate behavioral ecology. So in 2008, I began pursuing an Anthropology degree at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I quickly discovered that molecular biology, microbiology, and genetics were more my speed. Microbial evolution and physiology became my new lifelong obsession. I could not (and still can't) stop thinking about the ways microbial physiology influences host organisms: the intricate ways in which microbes have influenced mankind, but also how mankind has alterred microbial physiology. I complemented my Anthropology degree with a second major in Microbiology. My undergraduate research very much mirrored this transition, starting at the Wisconsin National Primate Center, studying rhesus macaques, and quickly shifting to bacteriology and the study of the metabolism of _Salmonella enterica_. 

By the time I obtained my BS in 2012, I was hooked on the worlds of chemistry, genetics, and biochemistry, choosing to continue at the University of Wisconsin, Madison for my PhD, where I studied natural product biosynthesis and the complex enzyme structures that generate many important and clinically relevant antibiotic and pharmaceutical compounds under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Thomas. 

After completing my PhD in 2018, I am continuing my training in the laboratories of Dr. Rebecca Parales and Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Power at the University of California, Davis, where I am applying my biochemical expertise to understand chemosensory systems in soil bacteria and to understand the role of chemotaxis in host-microbe interactions. Chemotaxis is the ability to move directionally up or down a chemical gradient to the advantage of the motile organism. In 2020, I was awarded a USDA NIFA Postdoctoral Fellowship to begin to parse apart the chemoreceptor repertoire of _Ralstonia solanacearum_, a devastating plant pathogen responsible for bacterial wilt disease.
